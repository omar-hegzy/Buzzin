        We work with service providers who are managing Buzzin Access-Controlled Premises. We also work with carefully selected service providers that carry out certain functions on our behalf.

        One example of our service providers is Amazon Web Services.

    <div class="content">
      <h2>11. Sharing personal data with other organisations</h2>
    <p>This section explains how and why we share personal data with other organisations.</p>
    <p>
      We may also share personal data with other organisations, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>12. How we protect your personal data</h2>
      <p>
        We know how important it is to protect and manage your personal data. This section sets out some of the measures we have in place.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We apply physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personal data;</li>
        <li>We protect the security of your information while it is being transmitted by encrypting it;</li>
        <li>We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption to keep this data safe;</li>
        <li>We only authorize access to employees and trusted partners who need it to carry out their responsibilities;</li>
        <li>We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we carry out penetration testing to identify ways to further strengthen security;</li>
        <li>We will ask for proof of identity before we share your personal data with you.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
        Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard your personal data, it is important that you keep your login details and devices protected from unauthorised access.
      </p>
      <p>
        The personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by companies operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers. If we do this, we ensure that your privacy rights are respected in line with this Policy. The most common way we do this is to put in place a specific type of contract, a copy of this type of contract can be found here or through an approved scheme such as the Privacy Shield.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>13. How long we use personal data for</h2>
      <p>
        We will not keep your personal data longer than we need to, and will only use your personal data for the purposes set out in this Policy. We will always keep your personal data in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
        <br>
        In most circumstances this means we will not keep your personal data for more than 5 years after the end of your relationship with us. However, for certain data sets we have the following retention periods:
