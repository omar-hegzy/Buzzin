All you need is to pop the tablet we supply onto your reception desk. No wiring, no onsite servers, and no financial outlay. And no technical expertise is needed to set it up.
                      The Buzzin dashboard for property owners offers impressive data analytics tools that provide you with full control of accurate data that is stored securely in the cloud. Buzzin is not simply an app, it’s a GDPR compliant solution offering guaranteed data security. You will have real-time accurate and up-to-date information on visitors to your building, therefore offering greater security and peace of mind.
                      The Buzzin app allows for contactless entry, meaning your building or community will be Covid-19 safe for residents, visitors and staff.
                      By offering Buzzin in your building your reception staff/building managers can focus on other areas and offer greater service and added value to residents.
